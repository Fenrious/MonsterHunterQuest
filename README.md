# MonsterHunterQuest
My first game in any programming language. I wanted to explore Javafx 
through practice. I started this project soon after returning to programming.

Project Background: All of the artwork in the game was done by me using GNU 
Image Manipulation Program, but the concepts behind the work and the music 
all belong to Capcom. The game has heavy influences from Monster Hunter Tri
and Monster Hunter: World. I tried to incorporate as many elements of the
Monster Hunter series as I could.

Game Description:
The goal of each session in the game is to defeat the primary monster of the
quest. You select what monster you want to fight each time you play. When you
successfully defeat a new monster, you can upgrade your weapon. You can choose 
different maps to fight in. Each area of these maps will have a few things 
for you to collect to make the overall fight more doable. You can only collect
so much of each item, but you do keep everything between quests. Time in the 
game is entirely reliant on a turn-based system. Monsters will move around to
various locations. Plants will regrow. Debuffs will wear off. Every successful
action will cause a turn to pass. If something is unsuccessful, then no turn 
will pass. The short messages at the top of the screen help the player to know 
if something was successful or not. To help out the player, the monster that 
they are after will roar whenever the monster reaches its destination. This 
helps to make it easier to find the monster. Other monsters will merely wander
about. Other monsters can be killed for raw meat which can be cooked and eaten
to increase maximum stamina.

Status: Finished. Focusing on other projects now.

Added Disclaimer: I do not work for or with Capcom at this time. This is a 
fan-game I made to help give me a really positive experience with coding that
was not an assignment.

For those that just want to play the game, you just need to install the 
MonsterHunter.jar file then double click on it in your files.
